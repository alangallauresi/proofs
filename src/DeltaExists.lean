  **Theorem: Difference Implies Existence**
  **Axiom:** Difference exists, i.e., there exist x and y such that x ≠ y.
  **Goal:** To prove that if difference exists, then existence follows.

  There exist two distinct objects x and y such that x ≠ y.

  **Definition of MyExists (E):**
  A term `z` exists if there is some type α and a term `z` of type α.

  **Theorem (Difference Implies Existence):**
  If there exist x and y such that x ≠ y, then there exists a z such that E(z) holds.
  That is, at least one of x or y must exist in some form.
